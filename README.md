# JSQS

JSQS (also known as Junes Simple Quantum Simulator) is a Tool written in Godot Mono, and can be used to simulate a small (think 12 QBits or fewer) quantum computing circuit. 

This has been created as the practical part of my bachelor's thesis, but I may continue working on it in the future.

At the moment it features a barebones way of building a circuit in graph form, as well as a few tools to analyse said circuit.
