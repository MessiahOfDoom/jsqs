# JSQS

JSQS (also known as Junes Simple Quantum Simulator) is a Tool written in Godot Mono, and can be used to simulate a small (think less than 20 QBits) quantum computing circuit. This is being created as the practical part of my bachelor's thesis. Once it reaches a point where i'm happy with it, i may start to provide built executables under "Releases".
